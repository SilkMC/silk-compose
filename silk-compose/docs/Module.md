# Module silk-compose

Adds server-side Compose support to the game. This allows you to create any gui you want, without any limitations -
using a modern UI toolkit.

${dependencyNotice}

The Compose dependency is bundled with silk-compose, you don't have to include it yourself.

Don't forget to apply the `id("org.jetbrains.compose")` Gradle plugin and add the following repositories as well:

```kotlin
mavenCentral()
google()
maven("https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/compose/dev") // for unstable compose-jb
// maven("https://androidx.dev/storage/compose-compiler/repository") // for unstable compose compiler
```

## Usage

You can open a server-side compose gui and show it to a player using
the [player.displayComposable][net.silkmc.silk.compose.displayComposable] function:

```kotlin
player.displayComposable(8, 6) {
    YourComposableFunction()
}

\\@Composable
fun YourComposableFunction() {
    var clicks by mutableStateOf(0)
    Button(
        onClick = { clicks++ }
    ) {
        Text("Clicked \$clicks times")
    }
}
```

and that's it, you now have access to the world of Compose in Minecraft.

You can now have a look at the **UI** package (below) to see custom composable functions provided by fabrikmc-compose.

## Compose docs

There are docs at [Android Developer Website](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) and you can
find desktop specific documentation at the [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) repository.
Additionally, there is a  [community maintained playground](https://foso.github.io/Jetpack-Compose-Playground/).
For each Compose module, you can also find very useful API docs, e.g.
[the ones for Material 3](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary).
