"MINECRAFT" LINKING EXCEPTION TO THE AGPL

Linking this mod statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this mod. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
Affero General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of this mod give you
permission to combine this mod with free software programs or libraries that
are released under the GNU LGPL, GPL and with code included in the standard release

Note that people who make modified versions of this mod are not obligated to
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice
whether to do so. The GNU Affero General Public License gives permission to
release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it
possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
